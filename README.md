# NoDoxx
NoDoxx is an extension that help you protect your configuration values while displaying code to others.

By default it will hide your configuration values behind an overlay, with a button to display them again in both the menus(tools->"NoDoxx: Toggle config value visibility", or via a toolbar button that you can add via View->Toolbars).

Extension is open to unsolicited pull requests.

And be a dear and report bugs please. Santa clause will love you for it.

You can always find the latest version on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Thindal.NoDoxx), or by searching for the extension NoDoxx or Don't Doxx Yourself in Visual Studio.
